##**INTRODUCTION:**

The photo editing software is a simple python application that can be used to manipulate an image. With the help of this software we can perform simple commands on the image we loaded and then save the output image after processing.This program uses various libraries for image manipulation and for creating a user friendly interface.

##**FUNCTIONS:**

1.Zoom and pan
2.Brush
3.Flip
4.Rotate
5.Filters
6.Adjustments
7.Undo and redo
8.Open and save a file

##**SIGNIFICANCE:**

Photo editing software is a powerful tool used by photographers ,designers and individuals to enhance and manipulate digital images .Its significance lies in the wide range of capabilities and features it offers,allowing users to enhance image quality,crop and resize,apply filters and effects and many more.Overall, a photo editing software lies in  its ability to help users with comprehensive editing tools,creative possibilities and efficient workflow.

##**METHODOLOGY:**

Our project, photo editing software, involves using various modules for both frontend and backend . The major modules used are :
    1.Pyqt5: Used for developing the front end GUI framework and for loading the images that are to be processed.

    2.Opencv: This module is used to get real time mouse inputs for image processing.

    3.Pygame: With the help of this module we can display images in a separate window for cropping images and is also used to edit images with the brush function.

    4.PIL : A major image manipulating module used for all filters and adjustments related to an image in the program

    5.Imutils:Mainly used to resize the image to fit the window screen

    6.Numpy : Used in the program to convert an image into a numerical array for efficient processing of data 

The modules needed to be install beforehand are:
Pyqt5,pillow,opencv-python,pygame,imutils


##**CONCLUSION:**

With the help of this photo editing software we are able to make simple image processing and obtain the result and store the image for future references.
